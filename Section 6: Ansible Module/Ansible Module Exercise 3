Ansible Playbooks

Update the "Ansible Module Exercise 2" to add a new task in the beginning to add an entry into /etc/resolv.conf file for hosts. The line to be added is nameserver 10.1.250.10

-
    name: 'Execute a script on all web server nodes'
    hosts: web_nodes
    tasks:
        -
            name: 'Execute a script'
            script: /tmp/install_script.sh
        -
            name: 'Start httpd service'
            service:
                name: httpd
                state: present
                
    Note: The new task must be executed first, so place it accordingly.

Use the Lineinfile module
