Ansible Loops

The playbook currently runs an echo command to print a fruit name. 

-
    name: 'Print list of fruits'
    hosts: localhost
    vars:
        fruits:
            - Apple
            - Banana
            - Grapes
            - Orange
    tasks:
        -
            command: 'echo "Apple"'

Apply a loop directive (with_items) to the task to print all fruits defined in the fruits variable.
