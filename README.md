# Fundamentals-of-Ansible

Introduces the basic use cases of Ansible followed by an introduction to Ansible Inventory, Playbooks, Modules, Variables, Conditionals, Loops and Roles. Each section is accompanied by a set of coding exercises showing my hands-on experience in developing Ansible Playbooks.

# Why Ansible?

Ansible is a powerful tool for automation to the provision of the target environment and to then deploy the application. It helps you with configuration management, application deployment, task automation, and also IT orchestration. It can run tasks in a sequence and create a chain of events happening on different servers or devices. 
 
It's simple, powerful, and agentless providing provisioning, config management, continuous delivery, application deployment, and security compliance!

# Ansible's Features

    Ansible's natural automation language allows sysadmins, developers, and IT managers to complete automation projects in hours, not weeks.
    Ansible uses SSH by default instead of requiring agents everywhere. Avoid extra open ports, improve security, eliminate "managing the management", and reclaim CPU cycles.
    Ansible automates app deployment, configuration management, workflow orchestration, and even cloud provisioning all from one system.
